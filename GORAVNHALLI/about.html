                    <p class="para">When it comes to tourism, Karnataka is the fourth most popular holiday destination in India. One of the reasons, this state is so popular is because of its ornate temples like the Sri Mahalakshmi Temple in Goravanahalli. As the name suggests, this temple is dedicated to Goddess Mahalakshmi, the wife of Lord Vishnu and the Goddess of prosperity and wealth.</p>

                        The main idol of Goddess Mahalakshmi in the temple is believed to be self-manifested. According to local historians, in the early 1900s, a villager named Abbayya came into possession of this idol. He worshipped the idol at home and was blessed with wealth and prosperity. His home soon came to be known as Lakshmi Nivas in honour of his charity work. Abbayya brother’s Thotadappa also worked alongside Abbayya and worshipped the Goddess Mahalakshmi. One night the Goddess visited him in his dreams and asked him to build her a temple.
